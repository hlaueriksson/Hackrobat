As aspiring Software Hackrobats we are raising the foobar of casual software development by practicing it and helping others learn the hacks. Through this work we have come to value:

- Not only well-crafted software,
  - but also `software that is fun to write`
- Not only steadily adding value,
  - but also `adding passion`
- Not only a community of professionals,
  - but also `a fellowship of like-minded`
- Not only productive partnerships,
  - but also `rewarding friendships`

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
