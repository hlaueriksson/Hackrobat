# Manifesto for Software Hackrobats

> Raising the foobar.

As aspiring Software Hackrobats we are raising the foobar of casual software development by practicing it and helping others learn the hacks. Through this work we have come to value:

- Not only well-crafted software,
  - but also `software that is fun to write`
- Not only steadily adding value,
  - but also `adding passion`
- Not only a community of professionals,
  - but also `a fellowship of like-minded`
- Not only productive partnerships,
  - but also `rewarding friendships`

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
